Knowning python
=====================

Python is an easy to learn, powerful programming language. We all know that. But you need to know again what it is as your
gonna write this after a while,So lets know about python. 
If you already know about it so don't read it, skip it. 

Python has efficient high-level data structures and a simple but effective approach to object-oriented programming.
The ques here is "what is object-oriented programming?"
Well its Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm that represents the concept of "objects"
that have data fields (attributes that describe the object) and associated procedures known as methods.
Objects, which are usually instances of classes, are used to interact with one another to design applications and 
computer programs. C++, Objective-C, Smalltalk, Delphi, Java, Javascript, C#, Perl, Python, Ruby and PHP are 
examples of object-oriented programming languages.

ok lets head on . 
Python’s elegant syntax and dynamic typing, together with its interpreted
nature, make it an ideal language for scripting and rapid application development in many areas on most platforms.

So What do we know from it. 
We know python is very hard to do. But the guys who invented this shitty programming language are saying its so easy.
but its not that easy to learn. But you can do many things with it , So its one of the best language of the the world. 
So Learn it. 

====================================================================================

Guys lets learn now ok :v ? 
don't worry am not playing with you.

OK , the 1st thing is

If you do much work on computers, eventually you find that there’s some task you’d like to automate. 
For example, you may wish to perform a search-and-replace over a large number of text files, or rename and rearrange
a bunch of photo files in a complicated way. Perhaps you’d like to write a small custom database, or a specialized 
GUI application, or a simple game.

If you’re a professional software developer, you may have to work with several C/C++/Java libraries but find the 
usual write/compile/test/re-compile cycle is too slow. Perhaps you’re writing a test suite for such a library and
find writing the testing code a tedious task. Or maybe you’ve written a program that could use an extension language,
and you don’t want to design and implement a whole new language for your application.

Then Python is just the language for you.

You could write a Unix shell script or Windows batch files for some of these tasks, but shell scripts are best at moving 
around files and changing text data, not well-suited for GUI applications or games. You could write a
C/C++/Java program, but it can take a lot of development time to get even a first-draft program.
Python is simpler to use, available on Windows, Mac OS X, and Unix operating systems, and will help you get 
the job done more quickly.

Python is simple to use, but it is a real programming language, offering much more structure and support for large programs
than shell scripts or batch files can offer. On the other hand, Python also offers much more error checking than 
C, and, being a very-high-level language, it has high-level data types built in, such as flexible arrays and 
dictionaries. Because of its more general data types Python is applicable to a much larger problem domain than 
Awk or even Perl, yet many things are at least as easy in Python as in those languages.

I did said that python is hard but trust me python is way more better then those. Cause if your a Newbee then python
may be the just thing for you. 



====================================================
Now lets go on with what python allows you to do.
Python allows you to split your program into modules that can be reused in other Python programs. 
It comes with a large collection of standard modules that you can use as the basis of your programs 
— or as examples to start learning to program in Python. Some of these modules provide things like file I/O,
system calls, sockets, and even interfaces to graphical user interface toolkits like Tk.

Python enables programs to be written compactly and readably. Programs written in Python are typically much 
shorter than equivalent C, C++, or Java programs, for several reasons:

+the high-level data types allow you to express complex operations in a single statement;
+statement grouping is done by indentation instead of beginning and ending brackets;
+no variable or argument declarations are necessary.
==========================================================
Python is extensible: if you know how to program in C it is easy to add a new built-in function or 
module to the interpreter, either to perform critical operations at maximum speed, or to link Python programs
to libraries that may only be available in binary form (such as a vendor-specific graphics library). 
Once you are really hooked, you can link the Python interpreter into an application written in C and use it 
as an extension or command language for that application.

By the way, the language is named after the BBC show “Monty Python’s Flying Circus” and 
has nothing to do with reptiles. Making references to Monty Python skits in documentation is not only allowed,
it is encouraged!

Now that you are all excited about Python, you’ll want to examine it in some more detail. Since the best way
to learn a language is to use it, the tutorial invites you to play with the Python interpreter as you read.

So you now know what really python is. Or do you ?
